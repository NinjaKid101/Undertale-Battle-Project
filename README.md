# Undertale_Battle
This is a game made with Java that attempts to replicate the battle scene of a popular video game called "Undertale". This was worked upon by Mervin Ng and Jonathan Domingo. This was a project created as our CSE 12B final project.

We used the Eclipse IDE to write and run the Java code. The file "Fight.java" should be used to run the game.
