# Undertale_Battle
This is a game made with Java that attempts to replicate the battle scene of a popular video game called "Undertale". This was worked upon by Mervin and Jonathan, two beginner programmers. This was a project created as our CSE 12B final project in 2016 when both of us were still beginners on programming.

We used the Eclipse IDE to write and run the Java code. Note there are way better ways to program/create the game, but at the time, the two of us only knew our limited knowledge of Java, Eclipse, and Java GUIs to make our idea into reality.

The file "Fight.java" should be used to run the game.
