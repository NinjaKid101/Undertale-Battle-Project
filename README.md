# Undertale_Battle

## Background
This was a final class project of CSE 8B at UC San Diego, concocted by two students who were beginner programmers. We had free reign of what to do, so we decided to make something fan-made from the video game "Undertale".

## Game
This is a game made with Java that attempts to replicate a battle scene of a popular video game called "Undertale". We used the Eclipse IDE to write and run the Java code. Note that this is basically spaghetti code from two beginners. There are way better ways to program/create the game, but at the time, the two of us only knew our limited knowledge of Java, Eclipse, and Java GUIs to make our idea into reality. Note that due to a shortage of time, we were only able to create scenes in which you are trying to avoid being damaged. There is no way to win the battle in the java application. There is a small chance you may encounter a Game Over screen that refers to the teacher assistant who helped us out while we were doing this assignment. We have no intention to come back to this ever again.

## How to play
To run the game, go to an IDE that supports running Java, and run the file "Fight.java". This should open up a window that is initially black screen. Clicking will proceed the game.

## Important Game Notes

- There is **NO WAY TO WIN THE GAME**. All the choices will not do anything and you will be stuck dodging obstacles for the whole time.
- To restart the game, you would have to close the window and run the Java file again. You cannot do anything once you reach the Game Over screen.
